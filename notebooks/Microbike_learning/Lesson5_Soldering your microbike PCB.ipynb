    " - open the soldering fan(picture later)\n",
    " - Wear safety goggles to protect your eyes from solder splashes and fumes.(picture later)goggles are on the top of the soldering desk.\n",

    "#### During soldering: \n",
    " - Do not touch the sodering iron tip, it's extremely spicy! \n",
    " - Keep the soldering iron stable and use a stand to hold it when not in use.\n",
    " - Use a damp sponge or brass wool for cleaning the soldering iron tip.\n",
    " - Use tweezers or clamps to hold small components, keeping fingers away from the hot tip.\n",
    " - Allow the soldering iron to heat up completely.\n",
    " - Once hot, apply a small amount of solder to the tip and wipe off excess on a damp sponge to coat it with a thin layer of solder, enhancing heat transfer.\n",
    " - Place the soldering iron tip against both the component lead and the pad on the circuit board. This ensures both parts reach the soldering temperature.\n",
    " -  After a second or two, feed solder into the joint, not the iron. The solder should flow around the joint, creating a shiny, concave shape.\n",
    " -  Remove the solder wire first, then the soldering iron, allowing the joint to cool naturally.\n",

    "-  Check that the joint is shiny and smooth. A good solder joint should be cone-shaped.\n",

    "-  Use a multimeter to check for continuity and ensure all connections are solid.\n",
    "-  Turn off the soldering iron and unplug it.\n",
    "-  Dispose of solder waste, and clean up the soldering desk, put everything back to where they belong to. \n"
